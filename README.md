# This repository is part of my application to Glasses Direct

This repository contains a python 3 module consisting of a function and the related unit tests. The function input is a string and the output is a dictionary of the frequencies of vowels in it one by one, and the frequency of all consonants total. The function checks for illegal inputs, raising TypeError if it's not a string. Also it does not count invalid characters like commas, ampersands and other symbols. Vowels and consonants are limited to the English language.
